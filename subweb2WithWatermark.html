                        Yushan, located in Changshu City, Jiangsu Province, was called Wumu Mountain in the past, lying on the northwest of Changshu City, adjacent to the Yangtze River in the north, and Shanghu Lake in the south. It is a national AAAA scenic spot.<br><br><br>

                        It was named after the ancestor Yu Zhong (Zhong Yong) of Jiangnan, who was buried here after the death of Shang and Zhou Dynasties. The southeast foot of Yushan extends into the ancient city, so it has the reputation of "a half-a-century into the city". Yushan Mountain is divided into Yushan Park and Yushan National Forest Park. Yushan Park is part of the Liangshan Project in Changshu City.<br><br><br>

Yushan is located in the northwest part of the ancient city of Changshu, halfway into the ancient city, and is known as Wumu Mountain, Haiyu Mountain and Haiwu Mountain. It is like a lying cow, also known as a lying cow. Why is it called Yushan? It is related to the sage of the country, Zhong Yong.

        <p>1.	My Client is a student group. They are the officers of the Publicity Department of the Student Union of Changshu Institute of Technology. They want to show a webpage that introduces Changshu and Changshu Institute of Technology, and they mainly want to show natural scenery and cultural scenery like events or local food. Therefore, I decided to use the photos I took in the past two to three years to provide them with materials, and do this webpage with technical support.</p>

Besides, I added the @media styles separately for small screens.</p>
